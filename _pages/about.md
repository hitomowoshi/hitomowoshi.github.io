# Thinking is good, but dont overthinking

Unfortunately, I can't stop overthinking.
I think about my life, my past experience, my unreasonable feelings, new knowledge I learnt, my problems at work, my faults, my loves and hates...

There is a chaos symphony in mind mind that could drive me crazy at every time.
So I decided to create a nice place (this) to burry all those random annoying thoughts
Just a place into which I throw anything appears in my mind.
It could be chaotic, of course.

# A little bit about me

I will use the name *Fuku* most of the time

*Mai*, *Mailovemisa*, *Fuku*, *Hito* are the same person (me)
