# How were the programming languages named?

- **Python** When he began implementing Python, Guido van Rossum was also reading the published scripts from “Monty Python's Flying Circus”, a BBC comedy series from the 1970s. Van Rossum thought he needed a name that was short, unique, and slightly mysterious, so he decided to call the language Python.
- **Go/Golang** 
- **Perl** Perl was created by American developer Larry Wall in 1987. Initially it is `Pearl` which means `something valuable` but there was an existing language with the name. Then he changed the spelling and it became `Perl`
- **Ruby** was created by Japanese developer Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in the 1990s. Influenced by Perl, he also wanted to use the name of a precious stone and choose Ruby because it was the birthstone of a colleague and the next birthstone in the monthly sequence after Perl: June's is pearl and July's is ruby.
- **Java** was designed by James Gosling while he was working at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. The project was initially called 'Oak' before a highly caffeinated brainstorming session produced the name `Java`. `Java`, or `Jawa` in Indonesian, is the name of a large island in Indonesia that produces strong, dark and sweet coffee.
- **Kotlin** the language released by JetBrains in 2011, takes its name from Kotlin Island in Russia. The team wanted to use an island name like Java had - although it was technically named after the coffee rather than the island!
- **Swift** There is no clear answer to why Apple chose the name Swift
