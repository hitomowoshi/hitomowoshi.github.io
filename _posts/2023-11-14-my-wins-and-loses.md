Inspired from [8 common interviewing mistakes](https://levelupsoftwareengineering.substack.com/p/common-interviewing-mistakes) where I first came up with a new terminology: **Brag docs**

- Every day keep a little log of your daily wins and learnings.
- Every other week summarize these into bigger wins.
- Look to quantify them where ever possible – you may need to talk with business and product leaders to get some actual numbers.
- Every couple months, summarize those wins again until it’s just your best ones
- Use these wins and learnings in your resume, performance reviews, interviews, etc.

Here I want to make it my own version, where I capture both my wins and loses. :o: is win, :x: is lose

:x: I merged a MR to production while It was having conflicts and I resolved it by myself and didn't review it correctly. There was mistake when I resolved, as a consequence, It freeze customer's POS operations for half of a day.

:x: I tested a feature that I was not sure what does it do in my local database. But that database is a backup of production and still have credential of production, as a consequence, it sent a bill of 150 million VND to my customer's partner :)
